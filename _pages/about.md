I'm an undergraduate at the University of Illinois Chicago studying neuroscience and computational mathematics. Currently researching psychiatric disorders with Dr. Katherine McMurray, with a particular focus on comorbidity between alcohol use disorders and panic disorder. I'm interested in the fundamental princples of distributed computation in biological brains.
